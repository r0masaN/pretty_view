# collections_io_streams
Simple C++ library that complements 'std' by adding custom overloading for '&lt;&lt;' and '>>' operators in 'iostream' for standard collections ('vector', 'map', etc.)

## Usage for 'ostream'
0. if you use your custom type 'T', you should write your own overloading 'std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, T&)' for correct work!
1. depending on collection type, '#define \[COLLECTION\]_PREFIX/DELIMITER/POSTFIX "..."' if you need custom prefix, delimiter or postfix (by default it's "\[", ", " and "\]" for all collections and "{", ": " and "}" for 'pair')
2. #include needed header ('\[collection\]_ostream.hpp')
3. easily print selected collection with any 'ostream' with '<<' like default types

## UPD:
Everything in all folders **except** `pretty_view` is bullshit for toddlers from kindergarten)
The **real** unified tool for cozy writing in ostream is pretty_view.hpp thing) it's freaking wild.
And I've spent literally 6+ hours in a row for this 🤪

## Usage of the `pretty_view`
```c++
ostream << ... << rmsn::pretty_view(N) << ...;
```
where N is any collection or tuple-like thing (thanks to ADL nothing bad happens with this overloading)
Structure of struct `pretty_view`:
```c++
struct pretty_view {
    const T& t;
    const char *col_pref, *col_delim, *col_post, *tup_pref, *tup_delim, *tup_post;
};
```
where **col = collection**, **tup = tuple**, **pref = prefix**, **post = postfix** and **delim = delimiter**
Ofc you can set them yourself
